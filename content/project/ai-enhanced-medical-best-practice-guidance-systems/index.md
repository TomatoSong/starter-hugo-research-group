People live longer. Seriously ill patients have multiple chronic diseases. Multiple pathophysiological processes and their interactions must be tracked concurrently. Because of the interactions between organ dysfunctions and drug side effects, the treatment of one organ may worsen the impairment of another organ. Keeping track of the dynamics of complex diseases, e.g., sepsis, mentally is error-prone, especially during handover between medical staff. According to a 2016 study by the CDC, each year at least 1.7 million adults in America develop sepsis.

Our goal is to turn the tide through the research on computational pathophysiology models and use these models to develop medical best practice systems.
