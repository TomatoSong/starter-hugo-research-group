summary: >-
  

  To ensure the medical correctness of our computational pathophysiology models and the safety and effectiveness of our guidance systems, we partner with: 1) Dr. Jonathan Gehlbach and Dr. Paul M. Jeziorczak of OSF on pediatric sepsis and COVID 19 ARDS (lung failure); 2) Dr. Priti Jani of University of Chicago Medical Center on COVID 19 cardiopulmonary arrest resuscitation and 3) with Dr. Karen White of Carle Foundation Hospital on adult cardiac arrest resuscitation.


  Like GPS navigation transforming the navigation history, we shall demonstrate that AI-enhanced and computational pathophysiology model-based medical best practice guidance systems will transform clinical practice.


  Funded through support from NSF grants 1329886 “Integrated Emergency CPS - Human Systems,” and NSF1545002 “An Executable Distributed Medical Best Practice Guidance System for End-to-End Emergency Care from Rural to Regional Center,” we have been working with


  Carle Foundation Hospital on cardiac arrest and adult sepsis, and recently with OSF Children’s Hospital of Illinois on pediatric sepsis. Since the start of COVID, we are funded by C3.ai to integrate AI-based early warning with our guidance system technology to create:


  * COVID 19 ARDS (lung failure) guidance system with OSF Children’s Hospital of Illinois, Here is the demonstration prototype

  * COVID 19 Cardiopulmonary arrest resuscitation system with University of Chicago Medical Center. We are in the process of creating a demonstration prototype
