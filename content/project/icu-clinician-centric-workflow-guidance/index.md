It guides medical staff through the best practice in real-time at the bedside. Each recommendation from our system consists of 1) what to do, 2) the list of abnormalities that trigger the recommendation, and 3) a reference to the applicable medical best practice text.  The link between patient conditions and matching best practices has been the key to a high compliance rate. The accurately recorded patient condition and treatment makes *handover* much easier.



Like GPS navigation transforming the navigation history, we shall demonstrate that AI-enhanced and computational pathophysiology model-based medical best practice guidance systems will transform clinical practice.  

 

Funded through support from NSF grants 1329886 “Integrated Emergency CPS - Human Systems,” and NSF1545002 “An Executable Distributed Medical Best Practice Guidance System for End-to-End Emergency Care from Rural to Regional Center,” we have been working with Carle Foundation Hospital on cardiac arrest and adult sepsis, and recently with OSF Children’s Hospital of Illinois on pediatric sepsis.  Since the start of COVID, we are funded by C3.ai to integrate AI-based early warning with our guidance system technology to create:

·       COVID 19 ARDS (lung failure) guidance system with OSF Children’s Hospital of Illinois, Here is the demonstration prototype

·        COVID 19 Cardiopulmonary arrest resuscitation system with University of Chicago Medical Center.   We are in the process of creating a demonstration prototype.
