title: ICU clinician-centric workflow guidance
date: 2021-06-24T20:33:04.005Z
summary: It guides medical staff through the best practice in real-time at the
  bedside. Each recommendation from our system consists of 1) what to do, 2) the
  list of abnormalities that trigger the recommendation, and 3) a reference to
  the applicable medical best practice text.  The link between patient
  conditions and matching best practices has been the key to a high compliance
  rate. The accurately recorded patient condition and treatment
  makes *handover* much easier.
