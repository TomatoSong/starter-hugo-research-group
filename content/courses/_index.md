<h2>Medical Best Practice Guidance System</h2>

<br>
<span style="font-size: 16px">
Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US. In fact, preventable medical errors have been reported to be a lethal problem since two decades ago [1][2]. The latest studies have estimated the number of preventable deaths at over 22,000 a year in the United States [3]. A considerable portion of these preventable errors are caused by unintended deviation from the clinical best practice algorithms during a fast-paced and dynamically changing clinical scenario.

<span style="font-size: 16px">
Our solution to this is computerized clinical guidance systems, which is a form of clinical decision support systems that provide dynamic guidance and assistance to healthcare practitioners during their workflow in real-time at the bedside. We use computational pathophysiology to transform the informal description of medical knowledge to precise software that tracks and records complex disease dynamics. Like GPS navigation transforming the navigation history, we shall demonstrate that AI-enhanced and computational pathophysiology model-based medical best practice guidance systems will transform clinical practice.

We collaborate with exceptional expert physicians and researchers from various hospitals and medical research centers to ensure the medical correctness  and safety of our computational pathophysiology models and conduct clinical evaluations to verify the effectiveness of our guidance systems.
