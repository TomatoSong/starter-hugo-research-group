    <h2 style="color:#bbdefb">Medical Best Practice Guidance System</h2>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
      Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US. In fact,
      preventable medical errors have been reported to be a lethal problem since
      two decades ago [1][2]. The latest studies have estimated the number of
      preventable deaths at over 22,000 a year in the United States [3]. A
      considerable portion of these preventable errors are caused by unintended
      deviation from the clinical best practice algorithms during a fast-paced
      and dynamically changing clinical scenario.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
      Our solution to this is computerized clinical guidance systems, which is a
      form of clinical decision support systems that provide dynamic guidance
      and assistance to healthcare practitioners during their workflow in
      real-time at the bedside. We use computational pathophysiology to
      transform the informal description of medical knowledge to precise
      software that tracks and records complex disease dynamics. Like GPS
      navigation transforming the navigation history, we shall demonstrate that
      AI-enhanced and computational pathophysiology model-based medical best
      practice guidance systems will transform clinical practice.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:16px">
      We collaborate with exceptional expert physicians and researchers from
      various hospitals and medical research centers to ensure the medical
      correctness and safety of our computational pathophysiology models and
      conduct clinical evaluations to verify the effectiveness of our guidance
      systems.

        Poor quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is directly linked to
        detriments in patient morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in
        resuscitation continuous quality improvement (CQI) programs, in-hospital
        pediatric arrest survival rates remain low at a median of 36%. Our
        objective for this research is to develop a Pediatric Advanced
        Cardiovascular Life Support Guidance System that will uniformly improve
        the quality of resuscitation events in real-time by functioning as a
        dynamic cognitive aid, decision support tool and agent promoting
        adherence to resuscitation algorithms and CRM. We hypothesize the
        utilization of this system during cardiopulmonary arrests will improve
        both adherence to guidelines as well as CRM exhibited by team
        performance. The knowledge gained from this research will further inform
        the development of dynamic cognitive aids and decision support
        technology to improve the quality of resuscitation events and team
        performance in real-time.

      <p style="font-size:16px">
        The surge of severely ill COVID-19 patients greatly exceeds the
        available medical staff who have been trained to care for them. To
        address the lack of training in COVID-19 treatment and minimize the risk
        of preventable medical error under this stressful pandemic, we are
        funded by C3.ai to create AI-assisted COVID-19 ARDS (Acute Respiratory
        Distress Syndrome, i.e. lung failure) guidance system. This system
        models ARDS treatment guidelines published by authoritative medical
        associations using computational pathophysiology and incorporates
        patient status prediction models powered by c3.ai suite.

        People live longer. Seriously ill patients have multiple chronic
        diseases. Multiple pathophysiological processes and their interactions
        must be tracked concurrently. Because of the interactions between organ
        dysfunctions and drug side effects, the treatment of one organ may
        worsen the impairment of another organ. Keeping track of the dynamics of
        complex diseases, e.g., sepsis, mentally is error-prone, especially
        during handover between medical staff. According to a 2016 study by the
        CDC, each year at least 1.7 million adults in America develop sepsis.
        Our goal is to turn the tide through the research on computational
        pathophysiology models and use these models to develop medical best
        practice systems.

      To verify the correctness of software, we partner with Prof. Grigore Rosu
      to develop a physician friend executable formal specification MediK, which
      can automatically generate: 1) Flowcharts used in medical algorithms and
      2) Formal analysis tools (powered by K framework). An implementation of
      the guidance systems that can interact with any GUI applications through a
