          <p style="font-size:16px">
            Medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US. In
            fact, preventable medical errors have been reported to be a lethal
            problem since two decades ago [1][2]. The latest studies have
            estimated the number of preventable deaths at over 22,000 a year in
            the United States [3]. A considerable portion of these preventable
            errors are caused by unintended deviation from the clinical best
            practice algorithms during a fast-paced and dynamically changing
            clinical scenario.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:16px">
            Our solution to this is computerized clinical guidance systems,
            which is a form of clinical decision support systems that provide
            dynamic guidance and assistance to healthcare practitioners during
            their workflow in real-time at the bedside. We use computational
            pathophysiology to transform the informal description of medical
            knowledge to precise software that tracks and records complex
            disease dynamics. Like GPS navigation transforming the navigation
            history, we shall demonstrate that AI-enhanced and computational
            pathophysiology model-based medical best practice guidance systems
            will transform clinical practice.

          <p style="font-size:16px">
            We collaborate with exceptional expert physicians and researchers
            from various hospitals and medical research centers to ensure the
            medical correctness and safety of our computational pathophysiology
            models and conduct clinical evaluations to verify the effectiveness
            of our guidance systems.

            Poor quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is directly linked
            to detriments in patient morbidity and mortality. Despite advances
            in resuscitation continuous quality improvement (CQI) programs,
            in-hospital pediatric arrest survival rates remain low at a median
            of 36%. Our objective for this research is to develop a Pediatric
            Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Guidance System that will
            uniformly improve the quality of resuscitation events in real-time
            by functioning as a dynamic cognitive aid, decision support tool and
            agent promoting adherence to resuscitation algorithms and CRM. We
            hypothesize the utilization of this system during cardiopulmonary
            arrests will improve both adherence to guidelines as well as CRM
            exhibited by team performance. The knowledge gained from this
            research will further inform the development of dynamic cognitive
            aids and decision support technology to improve the quality of
            resuscitation events and team performance in real-time.

            Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a
            dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can rapidly lead to
            tissue damage, organ failure, and death. According to CDC
            statistics, every year more than1.7 million adults in the U.S.
            develop sepsis, and nearly 270,000 die from sepsis. Identification
            of sepsis in its early stages upon presentation to the emergency
            department is vital in preventing significant organ injury,
            prolonged hospitalization, and potentially death. We propose a
            computerized pediatric sepsis best practice guidance system for
            early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric sepsis.

            The surge of severely ill COVID-19 patients greatly exceeds the
            available medical staff who have been trained to care for them. To
            address the lack of training in COVID-19 treatment and minimize the
            risk of preventable medical error under this stressful pandemic, we
            are funded by C3.ai to create AI-assisted COVID-19 ARDS (Acute
            Respiratory Distress Syndrome, i.e. lung failure) guidance system.
            This system models ARDS treatment guidelines published by
            authoritative medical associations using computational
            pathophysiology and incorporates patient status prediction models
            powered by c3.ai suite.

            People live longer. Seriously ill patients have multiple chronic
            diseases. Multiple pathophysiological processes and their
            interactions must be tracked concurrently. Because of the
            interactions between organ dysfunctions and drug side effects, the
            treatment of one organ may worsen the impairment of another organ.
            Keeping track of the dynamics of complex diseases, e.g., sepsis,
            mentally is error-prone,&nbsp;especially during handover between
            medical staff. According to a 2016 study by the CDC, each year at
            least 1.7 million adults in America develop sepsis. Our goal is to
            turn the tide through the research on computational pathophysiology
            models and use these models to develop medical best practice
            systems.
