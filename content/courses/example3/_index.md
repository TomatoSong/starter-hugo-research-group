title: COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
linkTitle: Data Science
summary: The surge of severely ill COVID-19 patients greatly exceeds the available medical staff who have been trained to care for them. To address the lack of training in COVID-19 treatment and minimize the risk of preventable medical error under this stressful pandemic, we are funded by C3.ai to create AI-assisted COVID-19 ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, i.e. lung failure) guidance system. This system models ARDS treatment guidelines published by authoritative medical associations using computational pathophysiology and incorporates patient status prediction models powered by c3.ai suite.
