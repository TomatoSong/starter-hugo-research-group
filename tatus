[31m-title: Pediatric Sepsis[m
[31m-[m
[31m-summary: Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. According to CDC statistics, every year more than1.7 million adults in the U.S. develop sepsis, and nearly 270,000 die from sepsis. Identification of sepsis in its early stages upon presentation to the emergency department is vital in preventing significant organ injury, prolonged hospitalization, and potentially death. We propose a computerized pediatric sepsis best practice guidance system for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric sepsis. OSF Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Illinois and UIUC have been working together to transform OSFâ€™s internal pediatric sepsis guideline into a computerized guidance system: The Pediatric Sepsis Best Practice Guidance System. The system is now ready to be evaluated at Jump Simulation. [m

Despite advances in resuscitation continuous quality improvement (CQI) programs, in-hospital pediatric arrest survival rates remain low at a median of 36%. Our objective for this research is to develop a Pediatric Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Guidance System that will uniformly improve the quality of resuscitation events in real-time by functioning as a dynamic cognitive aid, decision support tool and agent promoting adherence to resuscitation algorithms and CRM. We hypothesize the utilization of this system during cardiopulmonary arrests will improve both adherence to guidelines as well as CRM exhibited by team performance. The knowledge gained from this research will further inform the development of dynamic cognitive aids and decision support technology to improve the quality of resuscitation events and team performance in real-time.[m[41m [m

 ## Project Background and Objective[m
 [m
[31m-Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. According to CDC statistics, every year more than1.7 million adults in the U.S. develop sepsis, and nearly 270,000 die from sepsis. [m
[31m-Identification of sepsis in its early stages upon presentation to the emergency department is vital in preventing significant organ injury, prolonged hospitalization, and potentially death. Effective care of critically ill patients requires reliable systems that mitigate unintended deviation from best practice, caused by cognitive overload, temporary slips in knowledge, or interferences in workflows. Numerous medical organizations recognize these issues and have published best practice guidelines. However, adherence to guidelines is an acknowledged challenge.[m
[31m-We propose a computerized pediatric sepsis best practice guidance system for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric sepsis. OSF Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Illinois and UIUC have been working together to transform OSFâ€™s internal pediatric sepsis guideline into a computerized guidance system: The Pediatric Sepsis Best Practice Guidance System. This effort was initiated by the strong support from Dr. Richard H. Pearl, Director of Pediatric Trauma and Surgeon-in-Chief at OSF. After he retired, OSF Pediatrics experts Dr. Jonathan Gehlbach and Dr. Paul Jeziorczak took over the baton and moved this project forward. The system is now ready to be clinically evaluated.[m
[32m+[m[32mPoor quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is directly linked to detriments in patient morbidity and mortality[1]. In-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation events are often fraught with preventable harms; medication errors, systems issues and suboptimal performance by individuals and teams[2]. Despite advances in resuscitation continuous quality improvement (CQI) programs, in-hospital pediatric arrest survival rates remain low at a median of 36% [3]. While we know the features essential for a high-quality resuscitation, we do not know a singular approach to achieve these elements.[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32mThe joint effort of the UIUC team lead by Prof. Lui Sha and the UChicago Medicine team lead by Dr. Priti Jani aims to develop a pediatric resuscitation guidance system that will uniformly improve the quality of resuscitation events in real-time by functioning as a dynamic cognitive aid, decision support tool and agent promoting adherence to resuscitation algorithms and CRM. We hypothesize the utilization of a pediatric resuscitation guidance performance system (GPS) during cardiopulmonary arrests will improve both adherence to guidelines as well as CRM exhibited by team performance.[m[41m [m

[32m+[m[32mDeveloped a prototype dynamic electronic decision support tool with an associated visual display that increases adherence to Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PACLS) algorithms. This new prototype is facilitated with flexible multi-platform encapsulation compatibility, integrated with real-time simulation scenario input, well-documented requirements traceability and formal verification capability.[m[41m [m

 ## Clinical Evaluation[m
 [m
[31m-The Pediatric Sepsis Best Practice Guidance System is now ready to be evaluated at Jump Simulation. Phase 1 of the study will consist of a series of experiments with eLearning pediatric sepsis simulated cases. Subsequent study phases will be contingent on results shown in Phase 1, though we expect that the results will be promising. OSF will seek FDA approval and NIH support to conduct further research and clinical trials.[m
[32m+[m[32mThe PACLS guidance system prototype is under clinical evaluation in The University of Chicago Medicine, Comer Children's Hospital Pediatric ICU simulation center, under supervision of Dr. Priti Jani. in a randomized, cross-over study to compare simulation-based team performance and adherence to resuscitation guidelines.[m[41m [m
[32m+[m[32mThe knowledge gained from this research will further inform the development of dynamic cognitive aids and decision support technology to improve the quality of resuscitation events and team performance in real-time. Prediction modeling may be used to guide clinical teams in real-time towards intra-arrest actions most likely to improve patient outcomes.[m[41m [m
